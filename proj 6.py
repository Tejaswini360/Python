"""Bugs in the original code:
guess is a string, but toss is an integer (0 or 1). Comparing them directly (if toss == guess:) will always be False.
Typo: guesss = input() should be guess = input().
The second comparison still compares string to int.
Thereâ€™s no handling of invalid input on the second guess.

 Improvements:
 Converts toss from int to string (toss_str) for easier comparison.
Ensures both guesses are validated.
Makes the game robust and clean."""
